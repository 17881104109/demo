Doctam,"This is a great bathing suit for curvy, busty women.  Base your size off your bust size.  Fits well & figure flattering.  I wore this in the Caribbean &. Swimming pool.  It fits well, didn’t sag & dried well.  Beautiful teal color!! I highly recommend!!  Very low price for the quality.",1,1,1,0
ciennakay,"I detest bathing suit shopping. After reading reviews, figured I would give it a shot. It is very flattering, it accentuates the bust and slims the waist. 5'2 143 lb and I bought the medium, it was perfect, love it! Will see how it holds up but at this price, I dont mind buying a couple times!",0,0,0,1
Amazon Customer,"Saw this swimsuit on the TODAY show website and I was intrigued...read the reviews, saw the pictures. For the price, I wanted to give it a shot. Received the black swimsuit yesterday and it is beautiful!! The fit is great (I would suggest going up a size - I normally wear an 8 but went up, as suggested by the reviews, and it fit perfect!) No trying on suits in poorly lit dressing rooms, no walking out of stores feeling like you will never get a new suit - ladies, this is the ONE!",1,0,1,1
Amazon Customer,I love that this swimsuit is sexy without being too revealing.  I usually wear a 16/18 and ordered this in an xxl(18) and I’m glad I did because the leg holes are smaller and I am heavier on the bottom. I purchased to wear on our honeymoon cruise and so glad I did! Only thing I don’t like is the fabric does feel a little cheap but for the price it’s wonderful ☺️,1,-1,0,1
jarreviews,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this suit! So flattering. I can't even tell you the number of great reviews. The rouching on the stomach hide a lot. It fits well around the legs (doesn't create any muffin top situations. The mesh is super cute and a little sexy, while still being fully covered and no need to worry about falling out. I've bought 3 I'm so pumped about them.",1,0,0,1
Taylor K,"Love this, I’m not one that likes to order clothes online because I’m scared they won’t fit the way I like but trying to find a swimsuit out of season was getting hard. I ordered this and I’m in love!! It’s a nice fit, I’m 5’8 and it’s works with my length. Imma curvy fit and I look great in this! Definitely worth the buy!!",1,0,0,1
happy in dallas,Good fit. Boyfriend likes it. Took it on a cruise and wore in pool several days and on beach/in ocean. Seems to be holding up well for the money. Is getting some fuzzy's on the derriere (like other clothes when getting worn out or maybe from sitting on non-smooth surfaces) but overall satisfied with this purchase :),1,-1,0,0
Sara Z,"I bought this for kiteboarding.  I needed something that would hold everything in place  but I didn't want a boring sports swimsuit.  This one is awesome, super sexy while still covering everything up and staying in place even when I smash against the water while learning how to jump.  Great little piece!",0,0,0,1
Kyndall Fults,"This swimsuit is really beautiful.  It was such a hit when three of us wore it to our girls getaway, all the other ladies jumped on amazon and order a few for each of them as well.  It is super flattering.  The pink is a Medium (regular dress size is a 12-14), the green is also a medium (regular dress size is an 8-10) the dark purple one is an XL because of her chest size, but it fit and covered amazingly on all of us.  Plus it is very secure and fitted but comfortable. The materials is not cheap or floppy at all.  I now own 5 of them because I love all the colors!!!",0,1,0,1
TheTab,I haven’t gone swimming in this but I LOVE it! Super flattering and sexy. I’m 5’9” 155lbs I carry all my weight in my boobs and mid section I got a large fits great! I’m very particular about how things fit so I ordered 3 highly rated swimsuits and this is the only I kept.,1,1,0,1
Amazon Customer,"I am 165 lbs and the XL is perfect!  This is a very beautiful one-piece swimsuit. Theshade of green is the kind of green i love.

K Sand,I am really happy with this suit! I purchased the olive green and love it. I have a hard time finding suits that fit my curves and short waist. I am 5’3” 36D 155 lbs and I went with a medium. The butt coverage is a little cheeky so be aware if you are not comfortable with that. The top and waist fit perfectly. I feel appropriately covered for my age but still sexy.,-1,0,1,1
Winnie,"I wanted to love this suit, the top is so well fitting and super sexy. But the bottom went up higher than I the picture let on. I normally wear a l and the bottom hit alittle higher than expected. I kept it to use in my private pool but I cant see me wearing it out on the beach",-1,0,0,0
g.benvenuto,Great suit! I agree with the other reviews that the leg holes are a bit tight but definitely not uncomfortable. Perfect amount of coverage balanced with the mesh and cut out back that gives it the perfect amount of style! I have large breasts and it fit well!,1,0,0,0
ch,this swimsuit was great when I first got it. but after one wear it had faded so bad. i have included before fading pics also to show the color. so sad because it’s such a cute suit. i will say I also have it in black and it hasn’t done this.,0,0,-1,0
tori pierce,This suite is even better in person. I did read reviews about going up 1 size due to the legs being tight. I am 5'10 155lbs 34D. and I normally am a M and ordered L.. It is perfect. The stomach area has just the right amount of ruching (if that is the right word). Now I want all the colors.,-1,0,0,0
Frugal Shopper,This was a awesome fit swimsuit. I ordered a large and it was perfect. The color was nice. The mesh in the front is perfect with the right amount of sexy. I did feel the neck was a little snug but nothing major. I will order another color for my next trip.,-1,0,1,1
JD,"Usually a Medium just about everywhere, dress size 10, I bought a Large in this and it fits well.  My only gripe is that it came so stuffed into a plastic sleeve that the removable cups in the bra are creased from packaging and unusable as they stick straight out and are totally visible.  I will have to find other cups to replace them (thankfully I could remove the bad ones easily).  If it had been folded cup into cup this would not have happened... so hopefully they read this comment.  Otherwise I'm happy with it for the price.",-1,0,0,0
Nichole,"I feel so beautiful in this swimsuit. I'll definitely be wearing it for a second summer. It still looks perfect after being the only suit I wore last summer. The elastic on the leg could be a little looser, but it's definitely not going to deter me from giving it five stars. I've never had a swimsuit that I liked more than this one.",-1,0,0,1
Gloria,This is the perfect swimsuit for mommas who just had a baby!! It has the perfect room for breast feeding and it hides the "baby fat" my husband loves this swimsuit on me!

Maxine Gordon,I was concerned about the fit since I haven’t bought a suit for quite a long time. But this suit fit me perfectly. Even the bust fit fine which is what I was worried about.

LaQuita,I love this bathing suit. It fits so good & made me feel so beautiful! I ordered a Medium. I’m about 160lbs & 5 even. I have butt & hips & a stomach.

Derek Poolman,"I’m updating my review with a higher rating because the company immediately contacted me to correct the issue. Good customer service goes a long ways!The bathing suit is adorable and fits great. Unfortunately, it has an awful smell to it, right out of the package.

A.G.R.,"I purchased this suit and although very lovely online, it was a little small. The top fit well but the bottom portion of the suit was very tight. I purchased a medium. I am 5’0 and 123lbs with 34D cup. I chose to returned the suit rather than get a bigger size since the cut of suit was not flattering on my 38inch hips. However it may fit well on someone less curvy.",-1,0,0,1
Tatianna,"I’m  175 lbs  and bought the large size in black. It is a nicely made flattering bathing suit.

TLM2481,"I received this suit very quickly and the style I’d cute and flattering.  However, it was inside out in the package which makes me believe it was returned and not inspected.  It also arrived with a hole in the mesh in the back. It also arrived appearing dirty with hair and white specs on it (see pictures).  On top of that it smelled like cigarette smoke.  Definitely returning!!!  Will think about trying again since it is a flattering suit but not sure yet.",0,1,0,1
DENISE,I hesitated buying a swimsuit on Amazon but this suit was amazing.  I always wear a tankini because one piece suits never look right on me. This suit has the perfect fit. Makes you look slimmer as well. I would actually wear it with jeans as a top.I bought one in blue as well.,1,0,0,1

Mel O.,"This was a very flattering suit for this 40 year old mom of three. The sheer panels give the impression of sexiness without revealing much, if that makes sense.

I haven't worn it yet but will update after my vacation to Hawaii.",-1,0,0,0
Jenna,"Love this suit! I bought the medium in the first place, I’m 5’3” 121lbs but it was too tight for me. It made my bum look funny because the material was too tight and the straps at the top cut into my neck/shoulders. I then bought the Large and it was perfect. Very flattering!! I got lots of compliments! Sexy but not too sexy and I can run around with my kids without feeling like I’m going to fall out! Get this suit totally worth the money!",-1,0,0,0
AE,"I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars mainly due to the sewing quality. There were threads hanging out and one seam was stitched in farther than the other side. I'm 5'5"" 165lbs and 34DD and ordered a large. It is a little snug through the bottom and mid-section. There is ample coverage in this suit with no cheeks hanging out. The chest stays in place pretty well and has padded cups, which I think may be removable. It adds a little sexy to a swimsuit while still covering all the right areas.",1,-1,0,1

Alexis Theis,This bathing suit fit and was flattering! The support for the chest is minimal (it has small cups in it) but to me it was just enough! True to size. I struggled for months to find a bathing suit i liked that was still somewhat sexy at the same time and this suit was perfect,1,0,0,1

I currently wear a size 6 or 8 depending on the brand for bottoms and smalls/4 for tops (36/B). I wanted a bathing sure that was a bit camouflaged in the belly area because I have IBD and sometimes get this 3-5month prego bloated look. I also wanted to a cute, but sleek, one piece for swimming at the gym. I ordered a sun hat and a cute sheer black sarong to use on the beach!

Amazon Customer,"I'm 5'4"" and weigh 150 and the large fit pretty good. Love the red color, it's slimming, flattering, and classy, but doesn't make me look 'squatty' like the black does per my husband. Would definitely buy again. Rated 4 starts because the coverage on the butt is not as much as I'd like. We'll see what happens when it gets wet. I tried the XL and it fit, but I chose to stick with the large because the coverage was the same in the butt, and most swim suits stretch when wet and I decided the XL would sag.",1,0,1,1
RK,"This swimsuit is a must have!! Sexy enough for you to feel great in it, & modest enough to wear around children... just what I was looking for!
